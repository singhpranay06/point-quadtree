# Simulation Of Point Quadtree

A C++ application that implements point quadtree and simulates the same using a simple renderer.

## Features

- The quadtree is implemented using classes.
- GUI and rendering is made possible using Simple Direct Media Library which is a C++ Library.
- The project is developed using C++.
- Platform used to build the project is VSCode.

## Usage

1. After downloading the project on the local system, double click on the main.exe file.
2. The user is provided with three choices, the 3rd should chosen only after either of the first two are chosen.
3. Option 1 is for manual input where the user is required to manually enter the point coordinates.
4. Option 2 is a little automated and instead asks for total number of coordinates to generate randomly.
5. After choosing the input type enter 3.
6. Then the renderer will start up and use the data to plot everything on a screen.
7. The user need to click on the blank screen once for the output to actually appear.


> NOTE:- The screen dimensions are 800 x 600, so make sure that the coordinates remain within the screen limits if manual input is chosen.
